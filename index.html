        The idea to upload custom images and preserve them after site reload was brought to me while I was working on my <a class="link" href="https://github.com/pufex/shopping-list-react-ts">Shopping List App</a>. User has the ability to add his own product to the app, which includes name, price and, of course, custom image.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The app is made in React TS, and at the moment of making this preview website, I have not implemented this functionality. However, I'm not gonna give it up, even if it's very difficult!
